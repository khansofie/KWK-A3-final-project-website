    Some suggested steps:
    * Change the page name in the <title></title> tags above!
    * Read through the comments to get a feel for the layout of the code (in this .html file and in the .css file!)
    * Change the text first, add decorations after!

    Other cool features:
    A) Add a favicon:
      1. Uncomment line 8 to see an example favicon appear on the browser tab!
      2. Upload an image to the "assets" folder (in the left bar)
      3. Replace "cake-logo.png" with the name of your image!

    B) Create a dropdown menu üçî

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      
      <p>The divide in STEM exposure between underprivileged and affluent communities contribute to a knowledge disparity due to differences in ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic status. Solutions emerge from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, making it vital to address the lack of representation and exposure to innovation inclusive for all.</p>

      <p>The data provides information of the percentages of Total % of children who were out of schools. The regions more affected by this issue are Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Middle East and North Africa.</p>

    <p>This study demonstartes how many tech companies have more female employees over male employees.They also lack people of color compared to white employees. </p>
      
    <p>With the lack of diversity within tech industries, it is apparent that the indutry may have biases when creating products due to the creators. Thus, we need a variety of people to create innovative and unbiased designs.</p>

    <p>Studies show that the amount of women fortune 500 CEOs throughout the years have increased, but only by merre single digits.</p>
      
      <p>With the lack of women CEOs there continues to be a lack of women who are leaders. This causes a lack of representation for young girls and discourages them from being innovators.</p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Below are some solutions that you can implement within your surroundings to increase STEM knowledge and it's importance:</p>
      <p>1. Start a STEM club at your school. Your club can include themes like: Not only will this increase student engagement, but it will also help students to learn more about this field and see if they are interested.</p>
      <p>Click here for more tips: <a href="https://carlyandadam.com/thecarlyandadam/how-to-start-an-elementary-stem-club">https://carlyandadam.com/thecarlyandadam/how-to-start-an-elementary-stem-club</a></p>

      <p>2. Research about areas in STEM that you are passionate about. You can look at people in the STEM field and be inspired by someone. Looking at their journey can start to help you think about yours.</p>

      <p>3. Look at STEM videos in areas of biology, chemistry, physics, or conduct experiments with resources you have available by following tutorials only.</p>
      <p>Here are some easy experiments to follow that will help to get you started: <a href="https://www.weareteachers.com/easy-science-experiments/">https://www.weareteachers.com/easy-science-experiments</a></p>
